	abstract = {We consider a one-way street that intersects n one-way (side) streets. Traffic approaching the first street is steady as are the flows on all side streets. Traffic signals are idealized as perfect on-off switches and traffic is treated as a fluid moving with a constant velocity on the main street. Total delay and total number of stops are evaluated for several types of signal coordination schemes. Some conclusions are:1. For any given common cycle time and given splits at each intersection, there is a choice of offsets (phases) that simultaneously minimizes both the total delay and stops, but it is not necessarily the one that produces a “through band” of maximum bandwidth.2. There are signal settings for which some signals operate on half or a third the cycle time of other lights, which give a main street delay equal to that for the optimal common cycle time setting but give less delay to the side street.3. Similar models are commonly used to find maximum through bands for two-way traffic, but it is not obvious that this is a suitable objective even for one-way streets.},

	abstract = {The analysis presented here is of a cost benefit evaluation of a road diet conversion, reducing an urban arterial street from two-lanes in each direction to one-lane in each direction with a middle turning lane. Livingston Avenue is located in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and is an oversized arterial corridor accessing the center of the city. The costs include increases in travel time from the capacity reduction. These are modeled with a VISSIM micro-simulation of the street. Safety benefits of road diets are one of the main reasons that these are pursued. Evidence on the safety effect suggests that road diet conversions of arterial streets in urban areas will achieve about a 19\% reduction in crashes. The benefits of crash reductions and the costs of increased delay are evaluated based on the value of statistical lives saved versus the cost of travel time. This is done for various different scenarios and includes robustness checks. Results overwhelmingly find benefits exceed costs over a 20 year period.},

	abstract = {We quantify the importance of early action to tackle urban sprawl. We focus on the long-term nature of infrastructure decisions, specifically local roadways, which can lock in greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. The location and interconnectedness of local roadways form a near-permanent backbone for the future layout of land parcels, buildings, and transportation options. We provide new estimates of the environmental impact of low-connectivity roads, characterized by cul-de-sacs and T-intersections, which we dub street-network sprawl. We find an elasticity of vehicle ownership with respect to street connectivity of –0.15—larger than suggested by previous research. We then apply this estimate to quantify the long-term emissions implications of alternative scenarios for street-network sprawl. On current trends alone, we project vehicle travel and emissions to fall by ∼3.2\% over the 2015–2050 period, compared to a scenario where sprawl plateaus at its 1994 peak. Concerted policy efforts to increase street connectivity could more than triple these reductions to ∼8.8\% by 2050. Longer-term reductions over the 2050–2100 period are more speculative, but could be more than 50\% greater than those achieved by 2050. The longer the timescale over which mitigation efforts are considered, the more important it becomes to address the physical form of the built environment.},

	abstract = {A manifesto by America's most controversial and celebrated town planners, proposing an alternative model for community design.There is a growing movement in North America to put an end to suburban sprawl and to replace the automobile-based settlement patterns of the past fifty years with a return to more traditional planning principles. This movement stems not only from the realization that sprawl is ecologically and economically unsustainable but also from a growing awareness of sprawl's many victims: children, utterly dependent on parental transportation if they wish to escape the cul-de-sac; the elderly, warehoused in institutions once they lose their driver's licenses; the middle class, stuck in traffic for two or more hours each day.Founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk are at the forefront of this movement, and in Suburban Nation they assess sprawl's costs to society, be they ecological, economic, aesthetic, or social. It is a lively, thorough, critical lament, and an entertaining lesson on the distinctions between postwar suburbia-characterized by housing clusters, strip shopping centers, office parks, and parking lots-and the traditional neighborhoods that were built as a matter of course until mid-century. It is an indictment of the entire development community, including governments, for the fact that America no longer builds towns. Most important, though, it is that rare book that also offers solutions.},

	abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

	abstract = {Recently cities have been converting traditional one-way downtown street networks to two-way operation partly because one-way networks are seen as confusing and as less conducive to economic activity and a livable environment and they require vehicles to travel longer distances on average. However, one of the main disadvantages of such conversions is thought to be a reduction in the network's ability to serve vehicles. Intersections in two-way networks can serve fewer vehicles per unit time than their one-way counterparts. Several studies have assessed the differences between these two types of networks, but most studies are site specific and do not consider the best possible two-way networks. This paper presents an analytical model that uses macroscopic analysis techniques to compare various one-way and two-way networks using their trip-serving capacities. This metric is a key indicator of network performance. Two-way networks can serve more trips per unit time than one-way networks when average trip lengths are short. This study also found that two-way networks in which left-turn movements were banned at intersections could always serve trips at a higher rate than one-way networks could, even long trips. Thus, the trip-serving capacity of a one-way network can actually be increased when it is converted to two-way operation if left turns are banned. In this way, livability and efficiency objectives can be achieved simultaneously. This framework can be used by planners and engineers to determine how much a network's capacity changes after a conversion, and also to unveil superior conversion options.},

	abstract = {There is a developing trend to change the flow configuration in urban downtown or central business districts (CBD) from one way to two way. However, it has been difficult to reasonably estimate the traffic flow resulting from the two-way conversion. This paper presents a multiple resolution simulation and assignment approach to estimate traffic and environmental impacts due to different flow configuration scenarios. It is based on the logical integration of an origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation method, a mesoscopic traffic simulation model, and a microscopic dynamic traffic assignment model. The dynamic traffic assignment model is employed in conjunction with a method to estimate dynamic OD demand from collected link and movement traffic counts to reassign the traffic onto the proposed two-way flow configurations. The reassigned traffic is then loaded into the microscopic simulation model to permit detailed analysis of traffic and environmental impacts. A case study based on the El Paso, Tex. CBD network is conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The application highlights the unique features in the methodological aspect and illustrates the considerable benefits resulting from the proposed MRSA framework. Possible drawbacks and benefits of the conversion are discussed.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transit-oriented developments (TODs) often consist of new housing near rail stations. Channeling urban growth into such developments is intended in part to reduce the climate change, pollution, and congestion caused by driving. But new housing might be expected to attract more affluent households that drive more, and rail access might have smaller effects on auto ownership and use than housing tenure and size, parking availability, and the neighborhood and subregional built environments. I surveyed households in northern New Jersey living within two miles of 10 rail stations about their housing age and type, access to off-street parking, work and non-work travel patterns, demographics, and reasons for choosing their neighborhoods. The survey data were geocoded and joined to on-street parking data from a field survey, along with neighborhood and subregional built environment measures. I analyzed how these factors were correlated with automobile ownership and use as reported in the survey. Auto ownership, commuting, and grocery trip frequency were substantially lower among households living in new housing near rail stations compared to those in new households farther away. But rail access does little to explain this fact. Housing type and tenure, local and subregional density, bus service, and particularly off- and on-street parking availability, play a much more important role. Takeaway for practice: Transportation and land use planners should broaden their efforts to develop dense, mixed-use, low-parking housing beyond rail station areas. This could be both more influential and less expensive than a development policy oriented around rail. Research support: Data collection and initial research were funded under contract with the New Jersey Department of Transportation.},

This study examined the effect of different street patterns on crash severity using the City of Calgary as a case study. In this study, street pattern is classified into four categories: grid-iron, warped parallel, loops and lollipops, and mixed patterns. Their effects on injury risk are examined together with other factors including road features, drivers’ characteristics, crash characteristics, environmental conditions and vehicle attributes. Pedestrian and bicycle crash data for the years 2003–2005 were utilized to develop a multinomial logit model of crash severity. Our results showed that compared to other street patterns, loops and lollipops design increases the probability of an injury but reduces the probability of fatality and property-damage-only in an event of a crash.},

MEASUREMENTS: Information collected from injured bicyclists or their parents by questionnaire on circumstances of the crash; abstract of medical records for injury data. Serious injury defined as an injury severity score {\textgreater} 8. ANALYSIS: Odd ratios computed using the maximum likelihood method, and adjusted using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 3854 injured cyclists in the three year period; 3390 (88\%) completed questionnaires were returned 51\% wore helmets at the time of crash. Only 22.3\% of patients had head injuries and 34\% had facial injuries. Risk of serious injury was increased by collision with a motor vehicle (odds ratio (OR) = 4.6), self reported speed {\textgreater} 15 mph (OR = 1.2), young age ({\textless} 6 years), and age {\textgreater} 39 years (OR = 2.1 and 2.2 respectively, compared with adults 20-39 years). Risk for serious injury was not affected by helmet use (OR = 0.9). Risk of neck injury was increased in those struck by motor vehicles (OR = 4.0), hospitalized for any injury (OR = 2.0), and those who died (OR = 15.1), but neck injury was not affected by helmet use. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of serious bicycle injuries cannot be accomplished through helmet use alone, and may require separation of cyclists from motor vehicles, and delaying cycling until children are developmentally ready.},

	abstract = {AbstractObjective
To assess the net impact on U.S. longevity of the decision to commute by bicycle rather than automobile.
Methods
We construct fatality rates per distance traveled using official statistics and denominators from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. We model the life-table impact of switching from auto to bicycle commuting. Key factors are increased risks from road accidents and reduced risks from enhanced cardiovascular health.
Results
Bicycling fatality rates in the U.S. are an order of magnitude higher than in Western Europe. Risks punish both young and old, while the health benefits guard against causes of mortality that rise rapidly with age. Although the protective effects of bicycling appear significant, it may be optimal to wait until later ages to initiate regular bicycle commuting in the current U.S. risk environment, especially if individuals discount future life years.
Conclusions
The lifetime health benefits of bicycle commuting appear to outweigh the risks in the U.S., but individuals who sufficiently discount or disbelieve the health benefits may delay or avoid bicycling. Bicycling in middle age avoids much fatality risk while capturing health benefits. Significant cross-state variations in bicycling mortality suggest that improvements in the built environment might spur changes in transit mode.},

	abstract = {Travel conditions on a road network are described by a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) only when traffic is homogeneously distributed over all of the network's links. Otherwise, a network's measured traffic states fall beneath its MFD, and network flow therefore falls below the maximum. The present study found that inhomogeneous link flowed in a network may emerge before the beginning of a peak period, even before persistent queues had formed. This finding is potentially problematic because it is known that inhomogeneities of this kind can persist in a network for long durations. Therefore, the inhomogeneities that are predicted for undersaturated traffic conditions may persist as the network moves to the brink of congestion, and even well beyond. If drivers are left to their own devices, a network will never serve its peak period demand at the maximum rate. Steady state conditions in undersaturated networks of signalized intersections were modeled in simple ways. Analyses were performed for an idealized street grid characterized by uniform origin-destination patterns and a more realistic demand pattern that resembles one in downtown San Francisco, California. Emergent patterns in inhomogeneous link flow were examined. Preliminary ideas to combat these undesirable patterns are discussed.},

Since the quality of OSM data can vary strongly, different aspects have been investigated in several scientific studies. In most cases the data is compared with commercial or administrative datasets which, however, are not always accessible due to the lack of availability, contradictory licensing restrictions or high procurement costs. In this investigation a framework containing more than 25 methods and indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality assessments based solely on the data's history. Without the usage of a reference data set, approximate statements on OSM data quality are possible. For this purpose existing methods are taken up, developed further, and integrated into an extensible open source framework. This enables arbitrarily repeatable intrinsic OSM quality analyses for any part of the world.},

The question of whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data imports from public domain data, or whether the currency of OSM data should rather rely on more traditional data collection efforts by active contributors, has led to perpetual debates within the OSM community. A US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early 2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of road data for the US by comparing the development of OSM and TIGER/Line data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas. In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for motorized traffic when compared with TIGER/Line street data, while significant contributions could be observed in pedestrian related network data in OSM compared with corresponding TIGER/Line data. We conclude that the quality of OSM road data could be improved through new OSM editor tools allowing contributors to trace current TIGER/Line data.},

City officials and urban planners have started a movement to convert downtown street networks from their traditional one-way operation to two-way operation. This effort seems to be largely successful—many cities (e.g., Denver, CO; Dallas and Lubbock, TX; Tampa, FL; Des Moines, IA; Salina, KS; Kansas City, MO; Sacramento, CA) have either recently made or are in the process of making such conversions. These conversions are intended to improve vehicular access and reduce driver confusion. Many additional factors go into this decision, but the general premise is clear: travelers and residents prefer two-way streets for a variety of economic and livability reasons, while traffic engineers and transportation planners believe that one-way streets serve traffic more efficiently.},

Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes.Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost.},

We find that traffic flow increased after implementation of two-way flow, but traffic accidents decreased.

It tests potential changes to the built environment in two different urban contexts; a street-car suburban location (circa 1920s–30s) and a post-war suburban location. The outcomes from these tests are used to offer insight into how autonomous technology may have different impacts across space. The outcomes also reveal AVs may impact modal decisions differently based on location, and how planners and policy makers might frame built environment solutions to promote sustainable and livable urbanism.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To compare child pedestrian injury rates on one-way versus two-way streets in Hamilton, and examine whether the characteristics of child pedestrian injuries differ across street types.Methods: The rates of injury per child population, per kilometre, per year were calculated by age, sex and socio-economic status (SES). Child, environment and driver characteristics were investigated by street type.Results: The injury rate was 2.5 times higher on one-way streets than on two-way streets and 3 times higher for children from the poorest neighbourhoods than for those from wealthier neighbourhoods. SES, injury severity, number of lanes, collision location and type of traffic control were also found to be significantly different across street types.Conclusions: One-way streets have higher rates of child pedestrian injuries than two-way streets in this community. Future risk factor and intervention studies should include the directionality of streets to further investigate its contribution to child pedestrian injuries.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study traffic behavior on three different street configurations: one-way streets, two-way streets, and two-way streets with prohibited left turns. This study is novel because it employs three assignment and simulation methods to evaluate the networks under different conditions: analytical formulations, a Static Traffic Assignment algorithm, and a microsimulation software with a Dynamic Traffic Assignment. In general, the study reveals that two-way networks provide the shortest distance traveled but they are severely penalized by restrictions in capacity at the intersections. One-way networks offer the longest travel distances but have intersections with very high capacity. They perform better in congested scenarios. Finally, two-way networks with prohibited left turns provide the best compromise between distance travelled and intersection capacity, making them suitable for many different scenarios. Their main weakness is the lack of route redundancy that can lead to large travel times when networks are congested.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.aap.2013.05.017},
	abstract = {The experiment investigated the extent to which risky street-crossing decisions by older pedestrians can be explained by declines in functional abilities. Sixteen young (age 20–35), 17 younger-old (age 60–67), and 18 older-old (age 70–84) participants carried out a street-crossing task in a simulated two-way road environment and took a battery of tests assessing perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities. Older-old pedestrians were more likely than young and younger-old participants to make decisions that would have led to collisions with approaching cars, especially when traffic coming from two directions was approaching at a high speed. Regression analyses identified several functional performance measures as predictors of these dangerous choices. Walking speed, which determined the time needed to cross, was shown to play the most important role. Time-to-arrival estimate, which informed the pedestrians about the time available for crossing, was found to be the second most predictive factor. Visual processing speed and visual attention abilities assessed via the UFOV® Test also came into play, allowing participants to focus their attention on the relevant available information and to make timely, correct decisions. Attention shifting was the fourth significant predictor, allowing pedestrians to adapt their crossing strategy to the oncoming road-traffic information. The results suggest that the greater risk of being involved in a collision as age increases calls for a multi-dimensional explanation combining age-related physical, perceptual, and cognitive performance declines. These findings have implications for improving older pedestrians’ safety in terms of speed limits, road design, and training.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a discussion of the challenges for research on the topic of vehicle miles traveled. We then summarize and critique evidence from the US on the association between 14 distinct factors and vehicle miles traveled. Our results quantify how much vehicle miles traveled can be expected to change in response to changes in policy or land use factors, including residential density and land use mix, as well as speciﬁc transport policies and programs such as transit improvements, road pricing, and programs aimed at changing people’s travel choices. Overall, though individual studies differ as to exact effect sizes, it is clear that local-level policymakers can take actions that are likely to affect vehicle miles traveled. However, we highlight gaps in the knowledge base at a time when decision makers at the local level are being increasingly called upon to take action to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Variation in effect size based on local context or interaction with related policies and programs has been left largely unexplored. In addition, experimental research designs that can identify causal direction are rare, and appropriate data that quantiﬁes vehicle miles traveled are often lacking.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1680/icsic.64669.203},
	abstract = {Agent-Based Model (ABM) is a promising tool for city-scale traffic simulation to understand the complex behaviour of the entire urban transportation system under different scenarios. In the ABM, traffic is intuitively simulated as movements and interactions between large numbers of agents, each capable of finding the route for an individual traveller or vehicle. This paper presents such an ABM development to reproduce the traffic patterns of the city of San Francisco. The model features a detailed road network and hour-long simulation time step to capture realistic variations in traffic conditions. Agent speed is determined according to a simplified volume-delay macroscopic relationship, which is more efficient than applying microscopic rules (e.g., car following) for evaluating city-scale traffic conditions. Two particular challenges of building such an ABM are addressed in this paper: data availability and computational cost. The key inputs to the ABM are sourced from standard and publicly available datasets, including the travel demand surveys published by local transport authorities and the road network data from the OpenStreetMap. In addition, an efficient priority-queue based Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to overcome the computational bottleneck of agent routing. The ABM is designed to run on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, thereby improving the computational speed significantly. Preliminary validation of the ABM is conducted by comparing its results with a published model. Overall, the ABM has been demonstrated to run efficiently and produce reliable results.},
